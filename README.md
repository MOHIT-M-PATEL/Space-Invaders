# Space Invaders

Space Invaders is a 1978 shoot 'em up arcade video game, developed and released by Taito in Japan and licensed to Midway Manufacturing for overseas distribution.

I have tried to replicate the game by using C++ language and using the graphics.h library.


## Documentation

To implement the C++ code install the graphics.h library file internally or externally whichever you find comfortable.

Copy-paste the code in a new .cpp file and hit run.

That's it!!
